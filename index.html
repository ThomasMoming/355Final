                <p><div>Released in 2020, the game has undergone years of prior promotion and market building, and has successfully attracted a high level of anticipation from gamers around the world.
                    Pre-orders reached a record 8 million copies, reflecting the huge interest in the game. Gamers are expecting a revolutionary open-world game, especially with CD Projekt Red's strong branding following the success of The Witcher 3.
                    </div>
                    
                        <div>The game's sales plummeted in 2021 because the game's many delayed releases wore down gamers' patience
                            , causing some of them to begin questioning its quality. The game suffered from a number of technical problems after its release
                            , especially its poor performance on previous generation consoles, which triggered widespread dissatisfaction among players.
                             Word-of-mouth spread quickly, directly affecting subsequent sales performance.</div>
                    
                        <div>The game's sales in 2022 are picking up as CD Projekt Red has invested heavily in fixing the game
                            , releasing several updates to improve the player experience. 
                            As well as the successful launch of the Netflix animation Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
                            , the game attracted a new player base and increased its market popularity. 
                            In 2023, the release of the DLC Phantom Liberty has injected new content into the game
                            , attracting a large number of returning and new players. The quality of the game has improved after a number of fixes
                            , attracting players who were initially disappointed with the game to give it a try again.

                <p>The rise in sales figures from 18 million to 20 million between 14 April 2022 and 28 September 2022 may be 
                    attributed to the launch of the Netflix animation Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. The success of the animation attracted 
                    a new demographic of gamers, rekindled interest in the game world, and led to a rebound in game sales. 
                    However, on the following 20 December 2022, it slipped to 13 million. 
                    This decline may be attributed to the game's early word-of-mouth being affected by technical issues
                    , which despite being fixed by multiple updates, could not fully regain players' trust.

                    <div>By 5 October 2023, sales figures had rebounded significantly to 25 million. 
                        This was largely due to the release of the DLC Phantom Liberty, an expansion that brought new storylines
                        , characters, and gameplay mechanics to the game, further enticing existing and new players to purchase the game.</div>

                <p><div><b>Why is The Witcher series so anticipated as CD Projekt Red's next step?</b></div><div>
                    As the next step for CD Projekt Red, gamers‘ anticipation for the next instalment in The Witcher series stems from the stark contrast between The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077’s tumultuous journey. 
                    The Witcher 3 won universal acclaim for its intricate storyline, memorable characters, and polished execution
                    , while Cyberpunk 2077 was criticised for technical issues at its release, despite its ambitious narrative and world-building. 
                    This difference highlights CD Projekt Red's expertise in making immersive RPGs by focusing on their strengths
                    , which was showcased in The Witcher 3. Additionally, since the upcoming Witcher game is being developed using Unreal Engine 5
                    , fans are excited about the game's new leap in graphical fidelity and realism
                    , as well as the studio's signature storytelling approach. 
                    This return to the beloved world of The Witcher promises not only to be a polished and immersive experience
                    , but also an opportunity for CD Projekt Red to re-establish its leadership in RPG development.</div></p>
