                        When Cyberpunk 2077 was released in December 2020, it was one of the most highly anticipated games of the decade. However, the quality of the game failed to live up to the standard resulting in gamers experiencing numerous technical issues including game breaking bugs, poor optimisation and performance issues on older consoles. The number of players dropped significantly as disappointed fans abandoned the game. Retailers such as Sony even removed the game from their digital shops, further damaging the game's reputation.

                            In October 2022, Cyberpunk 2077 saw a brief but significant rebound in player numbers, thanks in large part to the release of the spin-off animated series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. 
                            The critically acclaimed Netflix series expanded the world of The Dark Nights with compelling characters and emotional stories
                            , rekindling interest in the game. Fans of the animated series were inspired to either return to the game or experience it for the first time, eager to explore the environments that served as the backdrop for the show's heart-wrenching narrative. The series succeeded in bridging the gap between media
                            , proving the power of cross-platform storytelling, breathing new life into gaming, and reawakening the imagination of gamers worldwide.

                            By October 2023, Cyberpunk 2077's player activity had once again risen dramatically, this time due to the release of the highly anticipated DLC, Phantom Liberty. The expansion breathes new life into the game with a gripping storyline, new gameplay mechanics, and enhanced visuals that address many of the issues players initially encountered. Not only does Phantom Freedom introduce exciting new content, it also demonstrates CD Projekt Red's commitment to delivering a polished and engaging gaming experience that attracts both veteran and new players to The Dark Nights. This resurgence highlights how well-executed expansions can reignite players‘ interest in the game, cementing Cyberpunk 2077’s position as an evolving and engaging game.

                The Cyberpunk2077 early release sparked a great deal of mixed reviews, with a large number of positive responses being overshadowed by a great deal of negative feedback.
                 Players were excited about the groundbreaking RPG, but were met with technical issues that left many frustrated and disappointed.
                Each quarter, CD Projekt Red worked tirelessly to patch, update, and improve the game, and it began to bear fruit.
                 By the end of 2022, a turning point came with the release of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, a spin-off anime that rekindled player 
                 interest and drove up positive reviews. Gamers were reintroduced to the game's potential and the vibrant world of The Dark City . This redemptive journey was further cemented by the release of the DLC ‘Phantom Liberty’ in Q3 and Q4 2023. 
                 Positive feedback surged as players returned to experience new content and improvements, dwarfing negative feedback. The chart illustrates more than just numbers, it's a journey about the story of how a game, initially plagued by controversy
                 , worked tirelessly to regain the trust and admiration of its community.
